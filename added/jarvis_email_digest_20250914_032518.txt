SUMMARY:
--------------------
Let's dive into your unread emails.

 ðŸŽ¯ Priority Alert Hey! I've got a big opportunity for you. You need to take action on this email from Devpost regarding the TiDB AgentX Hackathon 2025. There are only 3 days left, and you can't miss out on this chance to showcase your skills. Make sure you complete your registration and submit your PPT before the deadline on [Date]. This is a great opportunity to get noticed in the industry, so don't hesitate!

 ðŸ“¨ Quick Rundown Okay, let's quickly go through the other emails. It looks like EMAIL 1 from Team Unstop is a promotional email about preparing for Accenture jobs. While it might be helpful, I wouldn't say it's urgent. EMAIL 2 from DEV Community Onboarding seems to be an introduction to their platform, but again, not too pressing. EMAIL 3 from Unstop is another job prep-related email, which is similar to the first one. And EMAIL 5 from craftverse_comp2025 has incomplete registration details, but it's a bit unclear what the deadline is. Overall, these emails are mostly promotional or introductory, so you can take your time checking them out.

How do you feel about focusing on the TiDB AgentX Hackathon first?
