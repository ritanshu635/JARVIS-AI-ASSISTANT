SUMMARY:
--------------------
‚ö†Ô∏è Priority Alert! üéØ

Hey, I've got a big one here that needs your attention ASAP. This email from Tata Imagination Challenge is about an opportunity to participate in a hiring challenge that's tailor-made for you. The deadline is on September 15th, and if you don't act now, it might be too late. I recommend you focus on this first and get started as soon as possible.

 üì® Quick Rundown

The other emails are mostly promotional or informational. Here's a quick rundown:

- LinkedIn is inviting you to an event, but it doesn't seem too urgent.
- DEV Community Onboarding is asking you to refine your tags on their platform, which might be worth checking out if you're active there.
- Tata Crucible Campus Quiz is letting you know about an internship opportunity with the Tata Group, and you are eligible!
- Devpost is sending a reminder about an upcoming hackathon submission deadline, but it's not as time-sensitive as the first email.
- DevNetwork is inviting you to an online event, API World + CloudX + DataWeek 2025, which might be worth attending if you're interested in that topic.

Take your pick!
