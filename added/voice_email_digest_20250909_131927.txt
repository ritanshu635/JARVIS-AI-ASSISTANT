Total Unread Emails: 5

SUMMARY:
--------------------
I've analyzed the five unread emails for you.

Firstly, there are five emails in total that require your attention.

Now, let's break them down. The most urgent emails appear to be from Devpost regarding the TiDB AgentX Hackathon submission deadline (just 7 days left) and another email reminding you about the Code with Kiro Hackathon submission deadline (one week left). Both of these emails seem quite important, so it's worth taking a closer look at them first.

The other two emails are from DevNetwork and API World, inviting you to an online event. While they're not as time-sensitive, it's still worth reviewing their content to ensure you don't miss out on any valuable information.

Action items include submitting your projects and demo videos for both hackathons by Monday at 12:00 PM PDT.
