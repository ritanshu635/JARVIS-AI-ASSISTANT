Hello everyone, welcome to today's meeting. We're here to discuss the progress on our AI assistant project. The team has been working on implementing voice recognition and meeting transcription features. John mentioned that the desktop audio recording is working perfectly with the Realtek audio system. Sarah reported that the Ollama integration for summarization is functioning well. We need to finalize the Whisper transcription component by next week. The hackathon demo is scheduled for this weekend and we're confident about our chances of winning.
