ðŸŽ¯ Priority Alert

ðŸ“¨ Quick Rundown
Okay, let's give you a quick rundown of the other emails:
- EMAIL 1: This is a promotional email from Team Unstop (formerly Dare2Compete) with some free prep materials for Accenture jobs. Nothing too urgent here.
- EMAIL 2: Looks like an onboarding email from DEV Community Onboarding about your new home feed. Just take a few minutes to get familiar with it, and you'll be good to go!
- EMAIL 3: Another promotional email from Unstop with some exciting news about certification programs in India's top institutes. It sounds cool, but no deadline or urgency here.
