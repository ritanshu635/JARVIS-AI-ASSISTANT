SUMMARY:
--------------------
Boss, let's get down to business. üöÄ

üéØ Priority First: Devpost is reminding you about the hackathon ‚Äî the deadline is TODAY, we need to act fast! You've got a project to submit and some demo video tips to follow. Get on that ASAP.

üóÇÔ∏è The Rest:
There's also one from DEV... They're just asking you to refine your tags, nothing urgent. It's a good idea to tidy up your feed, but it's not time-sensitive. Maybe take 10 minutes to do it later.
Oh, Tata Group dropped a mail about internships... I feel this could be worth applying, sounds like a good opportunity. You should check the requirements and see if you're eligible. It might be a great way to get your foot in the door with a big company.
API World is just spamming you with event reminders... Honestly, boss, these events are all happening at the same time. I'd say tune out for now and focus on more important things. You can always check if you want to attend later.

What do you want to do first, boss?
