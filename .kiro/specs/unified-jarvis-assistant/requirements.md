# Unified JARVIS Assistant - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a unified JARVIS personal assistant that combines the best features from three existing implementations into a single, powerful, and locally-hosted system. The system will use free and open-source technologies including Ollama for AI, Whisper for speech-to-text, pyttsx3 for text-to-speech, and MongoDB for data storage.

## Requirements

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with an AI assistant that preferably runs locally but can fall back to cloud APIs when needed, so that I have reliable AI assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL attempt to connect to local Ollama instance first
2. WHEN Ollama is available THEN the system SHALL use it for general queries and content generation

4. WHEN real-time search is needed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate search APIs
5. WHEN image generation is requested THEN the system SHALL use available local or cloud services
6. WHEN content writing is requested THEN the system SHALL generate letters, essays, code, and documents
7. WHEN query classification is needed THEN the system SHALL determine if it's general, automation, or system command

### Requirement 2: Voice Interaction System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control JARVIS using voice commands and receive spoken responses, so that I can interact hands-free.

### Requirement 4: Desktop Application Control

**User Story:** As a user, I want to launch and control desktop applications using voice or text commands, so that I can efficiently manage my computer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user says "open [application]" THEN the system SHALL launch the specified application
2. WHEN the user requests a website THEN the system SHALL open it in the default browser
3. WHEN system commands are given THEN the system SHALL execute volume, shutdown, or window management tasks
4. IF an application is not found THEN the system SHALL suggest alternatives or report the error
5. WHEN multiple applications are requested THEN the system SHALL handle them sequentially

### Requirement 5: Desktop Web Interface with Jarvis-Main UI

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access JARVIS through the exact same beautiful interface as jarvis-main, so that I have a familiar and visually appealing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL serve the exact HTML/CSS/JS interface from jarvis-main
2. WHEN accessed via browser THEN it SHALL display the animated SVG loader and Jarvis hood interface
3. WHEN face authentication is enabled THEN it SHALL show the Lottie animations for auth process
4. WHEN voice interaction starts THEN it SHALL display the animated voice wave visualization
5. WHEN commands are processed THEN it SHALL show real-time status updates (Listening, Thinking, Answering)
6. WHEN chat history is accessed THEN it SHALL display the sliding chat panel
7. WHEN settings are opened THEN it SHALL provide the configuration interface

### Requirement 6: Contact and Data Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want JARVIS to remember my contacts and preferences, so that it can provide personalized assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN contacts are added THEN the system SHALL store them in MongoDB
2. WHEN searching for contacts THEN the system SHALL support fuzzy matching
3. WHEN user preferences are set THEN the system SHALL persist them across sessions
4. IF data corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL have backup and recovery mechanisms
5. WHEN importing contacts THEN the system SHALL support CSV and other common formats

### Requirement 7: Media and Entertainment Control

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control media playback and search for entertainment content, so that I can enjoy music and videos hands-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user requests music THEN the system SHALL play content on YouTube or Spotify
2. WHEN searching for videos THEN the system SHALL open YouTube with the search query
3. WHEN media controls are requested THEN the system SHALL handle play, pause, volume commands
4. IF streaming services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide alternative options
5. WHEN playlists are mentioned THEN the system SHALL create or access saved playlists

### Requirement 8: System Monitoring and Analytics

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see usage statistics and system health information, so that I can understand how JARVIS is performing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commands are executed THEN the system SHALL log them with timestamps
2. WHEN the user requests statistics THEN the system SHALL display usage analytics
3. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL alert the user
4. IF errors occur frequently THEN the system SHALL suggest troubleshooting steps
5. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide optimization recommendations

### Requirement 9: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a user, I want my interactions with JARVIS to be secure and private, so that my personal information is protected.
